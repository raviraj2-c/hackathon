# Food Delivery Service Website

This project is a **food delivery service website** created during a hackathon. It provides a streamlined, user-friendly experience where users can browse restaurants, view food items, add items to their cart, and proceed to checkout. Designed with an intuitive flow, this project demonstrates core principles of web development with a focus on front-end functionality, responsiveness, and interactive features.

## Project Overview
The Food Delivery Service website offers users an easy way to explore restaurants and their menus, build their order through a cart system, and proceed to a checkout page. This project aims to simulate a real-world food delivery app with a focus on clean UI/UX, efficient navigation, and engaging visuals.

## Features
- **Restaurant Dashboard**: A main page listing available restaurants, allowing users to select a restaurant and view its menu.
- **Food Menu Page**: Displays food items for the chosen restaurant. Users can add items to their cart directly from this page.
- **Cart Management**: Provides an overview of selected items, with options to adjust quantities or remove items.
- **Checkout/Payment Page**: A final page where users can review their cart, see the total cost, and proceed with a simulated payment.

## Tech Stack
- **HTML5**: Markup for structuring the website.
- **CSS3**: Styling for layout, responsiveness, and visual appeal.
- **JavaScript**: Provides interactivity, including cart functionality, navigation, and state management.

## Project Structure
The main files and folders in this project include:
- **index.html**: The homepage and restaurant dashboard.
- **menu.html**: The food menu page for displaying available food items.
- **cart.html**: A page to view and manage cart items.
- **checkout.html**: A simulated payment page to complete the order.
- **styles/**: CSS files for styling and responsive design.
- **scripts/**: JavaScript files for managing cart functions, item selection, and page transitions.
- **images/**: Assets including restaurant logos and food item images.

## How to Run
To view and interact with the project locally:
1. Clone or download the project repository.
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser to start with the Restaurant Dashboard.
3. Navigate through the site to view the menu, manage your cart, and complete the checkout process.

> **Note**: As this project was built for a hackathon, it does not include backend functionality or database integration.

## Future Enhancements
To expand this projectâ€™s capabilities, future enhancements could include:
- **Backend Integration**: Adding a server to dynamically load restaurant and menu data.
- **User Authentication**: Allow users to create accounts and track past orders.
- **Real Payment Integration**: Incorporating payment APIs (like Stripe or PayPal) to simulate real transactions.
- **Order Tracking**: Real-time updates for users on the status of their orders.
